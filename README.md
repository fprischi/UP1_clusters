**MD ensemble of structures**
A 2Î¼s Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation was performed by using Gromacs 2023 package. The NMR solution structure (PDB code: 2LVY) was used as a starting conformation. To generate an ensemble of structures, the MD trajectory was aligned and clustered by k-means clustering using MDAnalysis. 50 clusters were generated and the representative structure of each cluster are available here.
